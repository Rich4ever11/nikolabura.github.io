	<h2>LESSON ON: <i>LIMITS (GENERAL CONCEPT)</i></h2>
	<h4>AP BC Final Project by Nikola Bura, Period 3</h4>
	<h4><a href="index.html"> >> Return to Home << </a></h4>
	<hr>
	`lim_(x->?)f(x)`
	<p>Limits are a very important concept throughout
		all of calculus. Although the notation can be
		confusing, they represent a pretty
		natural idea.
		</p>
	<p><i>Limits indicate what happens to a function as it
		goes to a certain value.</i></p><hr>
	<p>Let's take a look at a simple example function.</p>
	`f(x) = sin(x)`
		<div class="plot" id="plot1"></div>
		<script>
			functionPlot({
			target: '#plot1',
			width: 500, height: 200,
			disableZoom: true,
			data: [{
			  fn: 'sin(x)',
			  sampler: 'builtIn',
			  graphType: 'polyline'
			}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>Move your cursor along the graph. Watch the coordinates change
	as you move along the curve. <br>
		Now, let's look at a limit...</p>
	`lim_(x->0)sin(x)`
	<p>What does this mean? Well, the big text to the right - in
	this case `sin(x)` - is the function that we are referencing.
	Underneath the `lim`, it says `x->0`.<br>
		So we are looking for what
	happens to the function `sin(x)` as x becomes zero.</p>
	<p>This one is easy enough! Simply take the x-value, which is 0,
		and plug it into the function.</p>
	`sin(0)`<br>
	`sin(0) = 0`
	<p>And the answer to the limit is therefore `0`.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>When the function is <i>continuous</i>, meaning that
	it is never interrupted, or that you can draw the whole
	thing without lifting your pencil, limits are relatively easy.</p>
	<p>You simply take the "target" x-value and plug it into
	the function. But, unfortunately, it does become harder.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Let's take a look at a non-continuous function.</p>
	`f(x) = 1/x^2`
		<div class="plot" id="plot2"></div>
		<script>
			functionPlot({
			target: '#plot2',
			width: 500, height: 200,
			disableZoom: false,
			data: [{
			  fn: '1/(x^2)',
			  sampler: 'builtIn',
			  graphType: 'polyline'
			}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>Now you can pan and zoom the plotting screen by dragging it
	and scrolling your mouse wheel. Once again,
	move your cursor along the graph and look at how it
		behaves depending on your x-position.</p>
		<p>Now, let's look at another limit...</p>
	`lim_(x->0)1/x^2`
	<p>Remember: This limit is essentially asking us, "what happens
	to the value of `1/x^2` when `x` is approaching zero?"</p>
	<p>For now, forget about plugging in values. Just look at the
	graph above. Zoom out if necessary. Follow the curve with
	your mouse cursor - start from the outside and move in,
	horizontally, towards x = zero.</p>
	<p>What happens to the graph when you move in towards x = zero?
	It goes to extremely high numbers, correct?</p>
	<p>In fact, as you get very close to zero, this function will
	go all the way up to `oo`: infinity.</p>
	<p>So... What happens
	to the value of `1/x^2` when `x` is approaching zero?<br>
	The answer: the value goes all the way up to infinity.</p>
	`lim_(x->0)1/x^2 = oo`<br><br><br>
	<hr>
	<p>The last example demonstrated one reason why we have limits.
	You cannot simply take `1/x^2` and plug in `x=0`, because that
	would result in `1/0^2`, and you cannot divide by zero!</p>
	<p>Limits help solve this issue, because they do not indicate
	the function's exact value. Rather, they indicate what the
	function <i>is approaching</i>.</p>
	<p>In the last example, the function was nonexistent at the
		exact point of `x=0`.
	But by looking at the graph, it is obvious that it goes up
	to `oo` when `x` <i>gets very, very close to zero</i>.
		Limits are the mathematical
		way of showing this.</p>
