	<h2>LESSON ON: <i>DIFFERENTIATION (GENERAL CONCEPT)</i></h2>
	<h4>AP BC Final Project by Nikola Bura, Period 3</h4>

	<hr>
	`d/dx f(x)`
	<p>Up next, we will learn the concept of differentiation.
		This is, again, one of the most important ideas in
	calculus.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>First, let's review the idea of <i>slope</i>. We'll use a simple
		linear example function.</p>
	<div class="plot" id="plot1"></div>
		<script>
		functionPlot({
				target: '#plot1',
				grid: true,
				width: 500, height: 200,
				disableZoom: true,
				yDomain: [0, 5],
				xDomain: [0, 10],
				data: [{
				  fn: '0.5x - 1',
				  sampler: 'builtIn',
				  graphType: 'polyline'
				}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>How would one calculate the slope of this linear function?
	It is easy, of course...</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You take the total change in x-position. We
		started at `x=2` and ended at `x=10`. So the total
		change in x-position is `Deltax = 10 - 2 = 8`.<br><br></li>
		<li>Then you do the same process to find that the
		total change in y-position is `Deltay = 4 - 0 = 4`.
			<br><br></li>
		<li>Finally, divide the change in y over the change in x.<br>
		`dy/dx = 4/8 = 1/2`. So the slope is `1/2`.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Pay attention to that term, `dy/dx`. This is how slope
	is represented in calculus.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Now, that was all easy pre-calculus stuff, right?
	Yes, finding the slope of a linear function is easy.
	After all, it has the same slope at any point on the line.
	But what happens when the function is not linear?</p>
	<hr>
	<div class="plot" id="plot2"></div>
		<script>
		functionPlot({
				target: '#plot2',
				grid: true,
				width: 500, height: 200,
				disableZoom: true,
				yDomain: [-5, 5],
				xDomain: [-5, 5],
				data: [{
				  fn: 'x^3',
				  sampler: 'builtIn',
				  graphType: 'polyline'
				}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>Uh-oh.</p>
	<p>You can try finding the slope of this curve.
	Say the change in `x` is from `x=0` to `x=1`, and the change in
	`y` is from `y=0` to `y=1`...</p>
	<p>`dy/dx = 1/1 = 1`</p>
	<p>A slope of 1? Ridiculous!</p>
	<p>Clearly the function is flat near `x=0`, and much steeper
	near `x=1.5`. The issue is that this function is not linear.
		Its slope <i>changes</i> depending on the x-position.</p>
	<p>With functions like these, we cannot simply find one
	single "slope" that works for the entire function.
	So let's try a different approach.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Earlier, we found the slope on a certain interval, like
		from `x=0` to `x=1`. This is known as the
		<i>average slope</i> or	<i>average rate of change.</i></p>
	<p>But we want something better. We must find the slope
	at one specific, single point on the function.
	Let's do `x=1`.</p>
	<p>You can now zoom and pan in the graph below. Find `x=1` and
		zoom in very, very, very close into it.
	It is marked with a little red dot.</p>
	<div class="plot" id="plot3"></div>
		<script>
		functionPlot({
				target: '#plot3',
				grid: true,
				width: 500, height: 200,
				disableZoom: false,
				yDomain: [-5, 5],
				xDomain: [-5, 5],
				data: [
				{
				  fn: 'x^3',
				  sampler: 'builtIn',
				  graphType: 'polyline'
				},
				{
					points:[[1,1]],
					fnType: 'points',
					graphType: 'scatter'
				}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>If you zoomed in close enough, you should notice
	something about the graph. <i>It became linear.</i></p>
	<p>Or at least that's how it looks. The idea here is that
	you can indeed get the slope from specific points, because
	on a small enough scale, the curve appears linear - and
	you know how to calculate the slope of a linear graph!</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Remember the formula for finding an average slope?</p>
	`dy/dx = (y_"end" - y_"start")/(x_"end" - x_"start")`
	<p>So if we are trying to find the slope of `f(x)` at `x=2`,
	we could try finding the average slope
		from `x=1` to `x=3`...</p>
	`dy/dx = (f(3) - f(1))/(3 - 1)`
	<p>But we have already seen that this often won't work
	for non-linear functions. So how do we find the slope
	at one tiny, single, specific point?</p>
	<p>Remember: we <i>zoom in</i>.</p>
	`dy/dx = (f(2.0001) - f(2))/(2.0001 - 2)`
	<p>Effectively, we have "zoomed in" so far into the function
	that our change in x-position is only `0.001` - a tiny amount.
	On this scale, the function is probably linear enough
	to take its slope in the normal way. (Of course, this is
	just a lesson. In reality you should probably
	zoom even further in.)</p>
	`lim_(Deltax->0) (f(x+Deltax) - f(x))/(Deltax)`
	<p>This is the "official" limit-based definition
	of what we just did. As you can see, the change in `x`
	approaches zero, just as our change in `x` did when
	you zoomed in to the graph.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>What you just did was <i>differentiation</i> - finding
		the slope of a function at a given point.
	This slope is known as the <i>instantaneous slope</i>
	or <i>instantaneous rate of change</i> because
		it is taken at one specific instant.</p>
	<p>Here's the example function again, but this time,
	when you move the mouse over any point, it shows you
	the <i>tangent line</i> for that point.</p>
	<div class="plot" id="plot4"></div>
		<script>
		functionPlot({
				target: '#plot4',
				grid: true,
				width: 500, height: 300,
				disableZoom: false,
				yDomain: [-5, 5],
				xDomain: [-5, 5],
				data: [
				{
				  fn: 'x^3',
				  derivative: {
					  fn: '3*x^2',
					  updateOnMouseMove: true
				  },
				  sampler: 'builtIn',
				  graphType: 'polyline'
				}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>A tangent line, at the point where it touches the
	function, has the same slope as the function. Tangent
	lines are very useful for demonstrating differentiation.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Let's try the "zoom-in" strategy again
		with a different function.</p>
	<p>Find the derivative at the point `(2,1)`.
		For your courtesy,
		it has again been marked with a complimentary red dot.
	</p>
	<div class="plot" id="plot5"></div>
		<script>
		functionPlot({
				target: '#plot5',
				grid: true,
				width: 500, height: 200,
				disableZoom: false,
				yDomain: [-5, 5],
				xDomain: [-5, 5],
				data: [
				{
				  fn: '-abs(x-2) + 1',
				  sampler: 'builtIn',
				  graphType: 'polyline'
				},
				{
					points:[[2,1]],
					fnType: 'points',
					graphType: 'scatter'
				}]
		  });
		</script>
	<p>Spoiler Alert: It doesn't work.</p>
	<p>At `x=2`, this function never appears linear,
		no matter how much
	you zoom in. It always comes to a sharp point. So
	how do you differentiate this at `x=2`?</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, you simply cannot. This function, and
	similar functions which come to sharp points,
	are <i>nondifferentiable</i>.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Visually finding these instantaneous slopes
		on a graph,
	and targeting a single specific point is
		all well and good... but now,
	we will learn how to get a function
		known as the <i>derivative</i>.</p>
	<p>This derivative function, when we give it a
		target x-value, will return
	the instantaneous slope at that x-value on the original
	function.</p>
